/**
 * An application to test the HuffmanTree class. This application reads a text
 * file and builds a frequency table for the characters occurring in that file.
 * Once that table is built, it creates a Huffman code tree and then a string
 * consisting of '0' and '1' digit characters that represents the code string
 * for that file. It then reads that string back in and re-creates the contents
 * of the original file
